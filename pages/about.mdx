# About

Jacob Programming Language (AKA jacob.js) started from a thought of mine, that today programming can be a little hard for new users. 
When I tried to learn programming a few years ago, none of the programming languages I tried to learn were simple like Jacob.
That is why I created Jacob, which it's main purpose is to solve the hard starting point for new developers, while giving them a list of tools, 
which are easy to use.
