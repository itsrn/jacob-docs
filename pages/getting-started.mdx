# Getting started
In programming, there are two types of functions. One is called "void", which means that a function
does not return anything. The second, can return a value, such as a string, a number, or anything else.

**In Jacob**, the functions that their type is void called "Functions", while the second type that
return a value is called "Variables" (aka "System Variables").

In the functions section of the docs, you can view each function of Jacob functions with a description and example usage.

In the variables section fo the docs, you can view each variable of the Jacob variables with a description and example usage.

## Syntax
### Functions
The Jacob functions syntax is the following:
```
#functionName[Argument 1; Argument 2; Argument 3; Argument 4; etc..]
```
Every function is starting with "#" symbol, then the function name. The arguments for the function
are inside "[]" brackets, with a ";" seperating each one of them.

### System Variables (variables)
The system variables (aka variables) syntax is the following:
```
$variableName()
```
System variables does not have any arguments, while functions does.
